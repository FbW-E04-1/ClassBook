const text = `The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village  It 
stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West Country 
farmland  Not a remarkable house by any means - it was about thirty 
years old  squattish  squarish  made of brick  and had four windows 
set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly 
failed to please the eye  

The only person for whom the house was in any way special was 
Arthur Dent  and that was only because it happened to be the one he 
lived in  He had lived in it for about three years  ever since he had 
moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable  He 
was about thirty as well  dark haired and never quite at ease with 
himself  The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that 
people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about  
He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a 
lot more interesting than they probably thought  It was  too - most of 
his friends worked in advertising  

It hadn t properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to 
knock down his house and build an bypass instead  

At eight o clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn t feel very good  
He woke up blearily  got up  wandered blearily round his room  
opened a window  saw a bulldozer  found his slippers  and stomped 
off to the bathroom to wash  

Toothpaste on the brush - so  Scrub  

Shaving mirror - pointing at the ceiling  He adjusted it  For a 
moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom 
window  Properly adjusted  it reflected Arthur Dent s bristles  He 
shaved them off  washed  dried  and stomped off to the kitchen to 
find something pleasant to put in his mouth  

Kettle  plug  fridge  milk  coffee  Yawn  

The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in 
search of something to connect with  



The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one  

He stared at it  

 Yellow   he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get 
dressed  

Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water  
and another  He began to suspect that he was hung over  Why was he 
hung over  Had he been drinking the night before  He supposed that 
he must have been  He caught a glint in the shaving mirror   Yellow   
he thought and stomped on to the bedroom  

He stood and thought  The pub  he thought  Oh dear  the pub  He 
vaguely remembered being angry  angry about something that 
seemed important  He d been telling people about it  telling people 
about it at great length  he rather suspected: his clearest visual 
recollection was of glazed looks on other people s faces  Something 
about a new bypass he had just found out about  It had been in the 
pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it  
Ridiculous  He took a swig of water  It would sort itself out  he d 
decided  no one wanted a bypass  the council didn t have a leg to 
stand on  It would sort itself out  

God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though  He looked 
at himself in the wardrobe mirror  He stuck out his tongue   Yellow   
he thought  The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of 
something to connect with  

Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a 
big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path  

Mr  L Prosser was  as they say  only human  In other words he was 
a carbon-based life form descended from an ape  More specifically he 
was forty  fat and shabby and worked for the local council  Curiously 
enough  though he didn t know it  he was also a direct male-line 
descendant of Genghis Khan  though intervening generations and 
racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible 
Mongoloid characteristics  and the only vestiges left in Mr  L Prosser 
of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the turn 
and a predilection for little fur hats  

He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous 
worried man  Today he was particularly nervous and worried because 



something had gone seriously wrong with his job - which was to see 
that Arthur Dent s house got cleared out of the way before the day 
was out  

 Come off it  Mr  Dent    he said   you can t win you know  You 
can t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely   He tried to make his 
eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn t do it  

Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him  

 I m game   he said   we ll see who rusts first   

 I m afraid you re going to have to accept it   said Mr  Prosser 
gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head   this 
bypass has got to be built and it s going to be built!  

 First I ve heard of it   said Arthur   why s it going to be built   

Mr  Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit  then stopped and put 
it away again  

 What do you mean  why s it got to be built   he said   It s a bypass  
You ve got to build bypasses   

Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point 
A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A 
very fast  People living at point C  being a point directly in between  
are often given to wonder what s so great about point A that so many 
people of point B are so keen to get there  and what s so great about 
point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there  They 
often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the 
hell they wanted to be  

Mr  Prosser wanted to be at point D  Point D wasn t anywhere in 
particular  it was just any convenient point a very long way from 
points A  B and C  He would have a nice little cottage at point D  with 
axes over the door  and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E  
which would be the nearest pub to point D  His wife of course wanted 
climbing roses  but he wanted axes  He didn t know why - he just 
liked axes  He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer 
drivers  

He shifted his weight from foot to foot  but it was equally 
uncomfortable on each  Obviously somebody had been appallingly 
incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn t him  

Mr  Prosser said:  You were quite entitled to make any suggestions 
or protests at the appropriate time you know   



 Appropriate time   hooted Arthur   Appropriate time  The first I 
knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday  I 
asked him if he d come to clean the windows and he said no he d 
come to demolish the house  He didn t tell me straight away of course  
Oh no  First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver  
Then he told me   

 But Mr  Dent  the plans have been available in the local planning 
office for the last nine month   

 Oh yes  well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them  
yesterday afternoon  You hadn t exactly gone out of your way to call 
attention to them had you  I mean like actually telling anybody or 
anything   

 But the plans were on display     

 On display  I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find 
them   

 That s the display department   

 With a torch   

 Ah  well the lights had probably gone   

 So had the stairs   

 But look  you found the notice didn t you   

 Yes   said Arthur   yes I did  It was on display in the bottom of a 
locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the 
door saying Beware of the Leopard   

A cloud passed overhead  It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he 
lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud  It cast a shadow over 
Arthur Dent s house  Mr  Prosser frowned at it  

 It s not as if it s a particularly nice house   he said  

 I m sorry  but I happen to like it   

 You ll like the bypass   

 Oh shut up   said Arthur Dent   Shut up and go away  and take 
your bloody bypass with you  You haven t got a leg to stand on and 
you know it   

Mr  Prosser s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his 
mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive 
visions of Arthur Dent s house being consumed with fire and Arthur 
himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three 



hefty spears protruding from his back  Mr  Prosser was often 
bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous  
He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together  

 Mr  Dent   he said  

 Hello  Yes   said Arthur  

 Some factual information for you  Have you any idea how much 
damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over 
you   

 How much   said Arthur  

 None at all   said Mr  Prosser  and stormed nervously off 
wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen 
all shouting at him  

By a curious coincidence  None at all is exactly how much suspicion 
the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends 
was not descended from an ape  but was in fact from a small planet in 
the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually 
claimed  

Arthur Dent had never  ever suspected this  

This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth 
years previously  and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth 
society - with  it must be said  some success  For instance he had 
spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor  which 
was plausible enough  

He had made one careless blunder though  because he had 
skimped a bit on his preparatory research  The information he had 
gathered had led him to choose the name  Ford Prefect  as being 
nicely inconspicuous  

He was not conspicuously tall  his features were striking but not 
conspicuously handsome  His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed 
backwards from the temples  His skin seemed to be pulled backwards 
from the nose  There was something very slightly odd about him  but 
it was difficult to say what it was  Perhaps it was that his eyes didn t 
blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time 
your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf  Perhaps it was 
that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving 
impression that he was about to go for their neck  



He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric  
but a harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits  For 
instance he would often gatecrash university parties  get badly drunk 
and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got 
thrown out  

Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and 
stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he 
was doing  Then he would start guiltily for a moment  relax and grin  

 Oh  just looking for flying saucers   he would joke and everyone 
would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking 
for  

 Green ones!  he would reply with a wicked grin  laugh wildly for a 
moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an 
enormous round of drinks  

Evenings like this usually ended badly  Ford would get out of his 
skull on whisky  huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her 
in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn t 
matter that much really  

Thereafter  staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he 
would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to 
Betelgeuse  The policemen would usually say something like   Don t 
you think it s about time you went off home sir   

 I m trying to baby  I m trying to   is what Ford invariably replied on 
these occasions  

In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared 
distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at all  The 
reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery 
of the Betelgeuse trading scouts  

Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would 
arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded 
anywhere  particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth  

Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he 
knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them  He 
knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty 
Altairan dollars a day  

In fact  Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly 
remarkable book The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  



Human beings are great adaptors  and by lunchtime life in the 
environs of Arthur s house had settled into a steady routine  It was 
Arthur s accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional 
demands to see his lawyer  his mother or a good book; it was Mr  
Prosser s accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy 
such as the For the Public Good talk  the March of Progress talk  the 
They Knocked My House Down Once You Know  Never Looked Back 
talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer 
drivers  accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting 
with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to 
their financial advantage  

The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course  

The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in  

A shadow moved across him again  

 Hello Arthur   said the shadow  

Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see 
Ford Prefect standing above him  

 Ford! Hello  how are you   

 Fine   said Ford   look  are you busy   

 Am I busy   exclaimed Arthur   Well  I ve just got all these 
bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they ll knock my house 
down if I don t  but other than that    well  no not especially  why   

They don t have sarcasm on Betelgeuse  and Ford Prefect often 
failed to notice it unless he was concentrating  He said   Good  is 
there anywhere we can talk   

 What   said Arthur Dent  

For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him  and stared fixedly 
into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car  Then suddenly 
he squatted down beside Arthur  

 We ve got to talk   he said urgently  

 Fine   said Arthur   talk   

 And drink   said Ford   It s vitally important that we talk and drink  
Now  We ll go to the pub in the village   

He looked into the sky again  nervous  expectant  



 Look  don t you understand   shouted Arthur  He pointed at 
Prosser   That man wants to knock my house down!  

Ford glanced at him  puzzled  

 Well he can do it while you re away can t he   he asked  

 But I don t want him to!  

 Ah   

 Look  what s the matter with you Ford   said Arthur  

 Nothing  Nothing s the matter  Listen to me - I ve got to tell you 
the most important thing you ve ever heard  I ve got to tell you now  
and I ve got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom   

 But why   

 Because you are going to need a very stiff drink   

Ford stared at Arthur  and Arthur was astonished to find that his 
will was beginning to weaken  He didn t realize that this was because 
of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace 
ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of 
Orion Beta  

The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling  
and was played like this: 

Two contestants would sit either side of a table  with a glass in 
front of each of them  

Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as 
immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song  Oh don t give me 
none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No  don t you give me none more 
of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly  my tongue will lie  my 
eyes will fry and I may die/ Won t you pour me one more of that sinful 
Old Janx Spirit )  

Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on 
the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his 
opponent - who would then have to drink it  

The bottle would then be refilled  The game would be played again  
And again  

Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing  because 
one of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power  



As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed  the final 
loser would have to perform a forfeit  which was usually obscenely 
biological  

Ford Prefect usually played to lose  


Ford stared at Arthur  who began to think that perhaps he did want 
to go to the Florse and Groom after all  

 But what about my house      he asked plaintively  

Ford looked across to Mr  Prosser  and suddenly a wicked thought 
struck him  

 Fie wants to knock your house down   

 Yes  he wants to build     

 And he can t because you re lying in front of the bulldozers   

 Yes  and     

 I m sure we can come to some arrangement   said Ford   Excuse 
me!  he shouted  

Mr  Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer 
drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health 
hazard  and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around  
Fie was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that Arthur had 
company  

 Yes  Flello   he called   Flas Mr  Dent come to his senses yet   

 Can we for the moment   called Ford   assume that he hasn t   

 Well   sighed Mr  Prosser  

 And can we also assume   said Ford   that he s going to be staying 
here all day   

 So   

 So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing 
nothing   

 Could be  could be     

 Well  if you re resigned to doing that anyway  you don t actually 
need him to lie here all the time do you   

 What   


 You don t   said Ford patiently   actually need him here   



Mr  Prosser thought about this  

 Well no  not as such      he said   not exactly need     Prosser was 
worried  He thought that one of them wasn t making a lot of sense  

Ford said   So if you would just like to take it as read that he s 
actually here  then he and I could slip off down to the pub for half an 
hour  How does that sound   

Mr  Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty  

 That sounds perfectly reasonable   he said in a reassuring tone of 
voice  wondering who he was trying to reassure  

 And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on   said 
Ford   we can always cover up for you in return   

 Thank you very much   said Mr  Prosser who no longer knew how 
to play this at all   thank you very much  yes  that s very kind     He 
frowned  then smiled  then tried to do both at once  failed  grasped 
hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head  He 
could only assume that he had just won  

 So   continued Ford Prefect   if you would just like to come over 
here and lie down     

 What   said Mr  Prosser  

 Ah  I m sorry   said Ford   perhaps I hadn t made myself fully clear  
Somebody s got to lie in front of the bulldozers haven t they  Or there 
won t be anything to stop them driving into Mr  Dent s house will 
there   

 What   said Mr  Prosser again  

 It s very simple   said Ford   my client  Mr  Dent  says that he will 
stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you come and 
take over from him   

 What are you talking about   said Arthur  but Ford nudged him 
with his shoe to be quiet  

 You want me   said Mr  Prosser  spelling out this new thought to 
himself   to come and lie there     

 Yes   

 In front of the bulldozer   

 Yes   

 Instead of Mr  Dent   

 Yes   



 In the mud   

 In  as you say it  the mud   

As soon as Mr  Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser 
after all  it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was 
more like the world as he knew it  He sighed  

 In return for which you will take Mr  Dent with you down to the 
pub   

 That s it   said Ford   That s it exactly   

Mr  Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped  

 Promise   

 Promise   said Ford  He turned to Arthur  

 Come on   he said to him   get up and let the man lie down   

Arthur stood up  feeling as if he was in a dream  

Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly  awkwardly  sat down in the 
mud  He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he 
sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying 
it  The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed 
into his shoes  

Ford looked at him severely  

 And no sneaky knocking down Mr  Dent s house whilst he s away  
alright   he said  

 The mere thought   growled Mr  Prosser   hadn t even begun to 
speculate   he continued  settling himself back   about the merest 
possibility of crossing my mind   

He saw the bulldozer driver s union representative approaching 
and let his head sink back and closed his eyes  He was trying to 
marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a 
mental health hazard himself  He was far from certain about this - his 
mind seemed to be full of noise  horses  smoke  and the stench of 
blood  This always happened when he felt miserable and put upon  
and he had never been able to explain it to himself  In a high 
dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with 
rage  but Mr  Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered  He 
began to fell little pricks of water behind the eyelids  Bureaucratic 
cock-ups  angry men lying in the mud  indecipherable strangers 
handing out inexplicable humiliations and an unidentified army of 
horsemen laughing at him in his head - what a day  



What a day  Ford Prefect knew that it didn t matter a pair of 
dingo s kidneys whether Arthur s house got knocked down or not now  
Arthur remained very worried  

 But can we trust him   he said  

 Myself I d trust him to the end of the Earth   said Ford  

 Oh yes   said Arthur   and how far s that   

 About twelve minutes away   said Ford   come on  I need a drink   `;
