### Objects

#### The Recipe Card

#### Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).
* On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:
- Mole
- Serves: 2
- Ingredients:
- cinnamon
- cumin
- cocoa


#### The Reading List

#### Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

* Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
* Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
* Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
