 *

 * 
 * - A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
 * 
 * - A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) 
 * with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
 * In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function.
