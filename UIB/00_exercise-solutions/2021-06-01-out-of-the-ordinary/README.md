# Movie Genres

**Instructions**:

1.  Create a section with the class `genres`. Make it a flex-container.
2.  Inside the flex-container, create 6 sections with the following content and background-colors. They should be created in the following order:
    - Action → dodgerblue
    - Thriller → rgb(190, 178, 178)
    - Comedy → rgb(255, 214, 30)
    - Horror → black
    - Drama → darkgrey
    - Romance → red
3.  For each section, center the font.
4.  Each flex-item should have a basic width of 500px and a fixed height of 100px. By default, each flex-item should take up all extra space.
5.  Now, make an exception for "thriller" and "comedy", Both sections should take up 10 times the amount of extra-space of their adjacent element.
    
**Hint**: Consider using flex-wrap.
