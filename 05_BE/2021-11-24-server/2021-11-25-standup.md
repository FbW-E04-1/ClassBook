## Plan

  - work as a developer
    - reading (modes)
	- abstraction

- why "Clean Code" by Robert Martin (search for it add "pdf")
  - short term memory

- fix: query-parameter bug
- change to type=module

- commandline arguments
  - exercise build server with configurable PORT (given as commandline parameter)

- exercise demo (commandline PORT parameter)

- IP-Stack (talk)
  - gateway

- live-coding
  1. json - server responding with "JSON"
  2. consume an API by an `HTTP GET`-request (with `axios`)
