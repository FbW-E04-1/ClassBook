# Password Reset

Scenario: user forgot password

Implement a process that allows this user to reset the password.

## Plan the Solution
Illustrate it with a diagram which includes the following parts:
1. user requests password reset
2. send email with link to a "password update form"
   the form's action is a new POST-route to do the actual update
3. the password is updated

## Present and Discuss the Solution
- Which new routes are needed?
- What about security?
- Could security be improved? How?

## Implementation
Implement the planned/updated solution.
