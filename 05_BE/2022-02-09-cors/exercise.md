# Exercise "CORS"

## Refactoring: CORS-middleware

Extract the current implementation of the CORS-middleware (`server.js`) into a separate file `middleware/cors.js`.

## Photographer
Implementations in Backend (BE) and Frontend (FE)
- BE: Create a PATCH-route to update a photographer.
- FE: 
  - Create a component with a form to edit a photographer (at least `name` and `password`). 
      
  Connect it with the Backend-Route from before.
