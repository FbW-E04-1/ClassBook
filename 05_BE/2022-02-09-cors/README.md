### Project Idea
In a group of 3-4 develop some project ideas and describe each in one paragraph.

Think about what the project should do, - technologies are of no interest at this point.

Describe the project as if you were the project's sponsor and are looking for a development-team.

### Group Finding

Around 5 project ideas groups need to be found.
Each group must be able to work fullstack (frontend, backend, database, ...).
