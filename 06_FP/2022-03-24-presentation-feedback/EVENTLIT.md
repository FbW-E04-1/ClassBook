# EVENTLIT

- When starting to speak, greet and introduce yourself.

- No "Thank you", especially not before the end, - and even there at least I do not like a "Thank you" page.
- Typo: "Danceholl" instead of "Dancehall" in the title of the first event.
- "Demo", content could be a story:
  - First Visit to page/application
  - Filter/Category
  - Login
  - Responsiveness

  - no comments on things missing or to be done, move that to a later section maybe "Challenges & Outlook", with:

- add "Challenges" and "Outlook" either as one or two slides, with:
  - styling
  - functionality
  - ...
