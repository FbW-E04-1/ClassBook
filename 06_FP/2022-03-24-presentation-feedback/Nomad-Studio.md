# Nomad Studio

- state your name slowly, and make a pause after the name

- too much text on the two "text slides"
  - first of those could be reduced to **"3 key points"**:
    1. freelancers & customers
    2. communication center
    3. track & share progress
  - "Why Us?"
    - reduce content, maybe something around the lines:
      "simple and easy to use"

- Correct spelling
  - on a slide: "Peacer of Mind" => "Peace of Mind"
  - in the app: "None [X] Found" => "No [X] Found"

- Briefer self introduction

- "Demo"
  - refer back to the **"3 key points"** (see above), which kind of proves that you "promise & deliver" <sup>(TM)</sup>

- Tech Stack
  - only highlight central technologies
  - optionally also technologies learned during the project
